## Welcome to HackBuddy.

console.log(`Welcome to HackBuddy`)

Our mission is to help you get better at coding.  While there's [JavaScriptLA](https://javascriptla.net), which is great for learning JavaScript, we felt we needed to do more for our members who might be confused about entering different "Web Stacks" after getting employed.

The real world isn't just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; you also have software on the "backend" running on systems like Windows and Linux using languages like **Python, Rails, Java, .NET, C++, PHP, SQL, NoSQL, Perl, Node.js** and / or more.  Compound all that with new terms / buzzwords that have popped up in the last few years like **"Cloud Computing", "Docker", "Azure", "AWS"**, and you'll start to realize that web development altogether is quite the proverbial "beast" to tackle.

Hence, we felt we needed a new website to help address these concerns.  **HackBuddy** is that website; made for you with love to help you learn more about all aspects of web development (and possibly software development, along with how the computer works at a very basic level). We'll even focus on things like optimization, like algorithms & practical data structures that once mastered will help you be even more of a coding expert!

Visit our site often for tutorials in the form of **blogs, videos, podcasts, special event seminars**; you can bookmark this page as well as join our newsletter.  Stay tuned!
